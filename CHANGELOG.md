# y2

## 0.0.7

<!-- release:start -->

### Breaking Changes

- **Provider routing:** Connect to Agent Y2 by default or call a configured OpenAI-compatible endpoint directly. Vercel AI Gateway routing is no longer available.

### New Features

- **Guided Y2 authentication:** Run `y2 auth` to open Y2 API Keys and securely save a key. `y2 setup` remains available as a direct-entry alias.

### Improvements

- **Y2 Information Dominance:** Use the Y2 name, terminal identity, configuration, and installation paths throughout the native harness.
- **Direct provider configuration:** Select Agent Y2 with `Y2_API_KEY`, `Y2_API_CHAT_URL`, and `Y2_MODEL`, or configure another OpenAI-compatible endpoint with `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_BASE_URL`, and `OPENAI_MODEL`.
- **Native installation:** Install checksum-verified release artifacts from the maintained `y2-intel/harness` repository through `https://y2.dev/harness/install.sh`. The initial macOS CLI archives are not Developer ID signed or Apple-notarized.

## 0.0.6

**New Gateway sessions use Kimi K3 with Fast mode, foreground commands require timeouts, auto mode reviews exact pending actions, and the macOS arm64 binary is 0.3% smaller (6.12 MiB vs 6.13 MiB).**

### Breaking Changes

- **Terminal presentation**: `/appearance`, `/input`, and `/maxxing` have been removed along with their saved settings. y2 now uses the same input and transcript layout everywhere.
- **Foreground command timeouts**: `terminal.exec` calls now require `timeout_ms` between 1 millisecond and 10 minutes. Use `terminal.start` for services, watchers, GUI apps, and other long-running work.

### New Features

- **Remote MCP servers**: `/mcp add --transport http <name> <url>` now saves or replaces a remote Streamable HTTP server and reloads MCP immediately. The existing local stdio form is unchanged.
- **Retained command output**: Captured command output can now be read later with `read_tool_result`, including after a saved session resumes. With `--no-save`, output remains available until y2 exits.

### Improvements

- **Auto mode review prompts**: Auto mode now uses fewer tokens when reviewing unresolved actions.
- **Native binary size**: The macOS arm64 binary is 0.3% smaller (6.12 MiB vs 6.13 MiB).
- **Gateway defaults**: New Gateway sessions now use Kimi K3 with Fast mode enabled by default.
- **Setup hub**: `/setup` now groups sign-in methods under Connections and shows the current provider, Legacy provider team, and credential source. Child screens return to the setup hub, and active sign-in controls remain visible in compact terminals.
- **Provider model preferences**: Gateway, Codex, and Grok now keep separate saved model selections, so switching providers no longer replaces another provider's preferred model.
- **Subscription session longevity**: Codex and Grok sessions remain usable beyond 64 consecutive requests.
- **Usage tracking**: Rejected completions no longer appear in usage tracking, and duplicate completion callbacks are recorded once.
- **MCP discovery**: MCP searches still find the selected tool when a request includes surrounding context, and another server's authentication failure no longer replaces an empty search result.
- **MCP authentication**: MCP authentication stays responsive while configuration reloads or logout is in progress, and pending authentication stops when MCP reloads or y2 exits.
- **Linked skill errors**: Linked skill errors now distinguish an unavailable linked directory from an unreadable `SKILL.md` and explain whether to repair, remove, or authorize the link.
- **Live permission modes**: `Shift+Tab` permission-mode changes now apply to later tool calls in the current turn. Actions already in progress keep the mode under which they were admitted.
- **Tool action summaries**: Denied and deferred tool rows now show the actual command or target, and those details and denial labels survive session resume.

### Bug Fixes

- **Terminal resize**: Terminal resizing no longer leaves empty scrollback behind.
- **Subscription sign-in**: Codex and Grok sign-ins now survive unrelated, stalled, reset, or stale browser connections. Grok authorization codes can also be pasted when the browser cannot return to y2.
- **OAuth callback pages**: OAuth callbacks now show a completion or failure page after returning from the browser.
- **Nested rebuilds**: Interactive terminal helpers continue working after a nested rebuild replaces the y2 binary on disk.
- **Terminal recovery**: y2 recovery no longer pauses commands already running in tmux.
- **Terminal cancellation**: Terminal cancellation no longer reports failure when the command exits during cancellation.
- **MCP resource compatibility**: MCP resources and prompts no longer fail on servers that require their configured name.
- **MCP credential recovery**: MCP credentials with no advertised scopes remain usable after restart. Malformed stored entries no longer prevent valid servers from loading and are removed on the next successful credential write.
- **MCP stdio environments**: Configured MCP stdio environment variables now override inherited values without discarding the rest of the child environment.
- **Captured command failures**: Captured command output remains readable after timeout or cancellation. Output-capture failures now fail the tool call instead of returning an incomplete result.
- **Resumed review labels**: The `Safety caution` and `Review unavailable` labels now survive session resume.

### Security

- **Exact-action reviews**: Auto mode reviews each unresolved action against the current request and relevant results from the current turn. A clear review applies only to that exact unchanged action and is checked again before execution.
- **Blocked cautions**: Cautioned or unavailable actions remain blocked without opening a permission prompt or ending the turn.
- **Untrusted tool output**: Actions copied from untrusted tool output remain blocked unless the user's request independently authorizes them.
- **Current-branch pushes**: Explicit pushes to the current branch use the branch reported by the local Git checkout rather than repository text.
- **Provider recovery authority**: After restart, y2 continues unfinished Codex or Grok work only for the account that started it. If that account cannot be verified, y2 preserves completed work and sends nothing.
- **Sensitive command output**: Command output flagged as sensitive is not saved with the session, including secrets split across output chunks or oversized lines.
- **OAuth callback validation**: OAuth authorization denials and successes apply only when the callback state matches the active sign-in attempt, and Grok browser callbacks accept only the expected xAI origin.
- **MCP issuer validation**: MCP sign-in stops before exchanging a token or saving credentials when the authorization response comes from a different issuer than the server advertised.

## 0.0.5

### Breaking Changes

- **Host command execution:** Run approved captured, background, and monitor commands as ordinary host subprocesses, and retire sandbox configuration, status fields, and commands
- **Interactive provider switching:** Move provider selection to `/setup` and remove the `/provider` slash command while keeping the top-level `y2 provider` command

### New Features

- **Codex subscriptions:** Sign in with an eligible subscription through `y2 login codex`, then use authenticated Codex models for interactive sessions, `y2 ask`, native ACP, images, subagents, and automatic reviews
- **Grok subscriptions:** Sign in with an eligible Grok subscription through `y2 login grok`, then use authenticated xAI models, effort levels, images, local tools, persistent sessions, and automatic reviews
- **Workspace status line:** Opt in to the active workspace path and Git branch through `/settings`, `/statusline workspace`, or `statusLine.workspace`
- **y2-native workspace skills:** Discover project skills from `.y2/skills` before other workspace and compatibility roots
- **External skill authorities:** Allow symlinked skills under explicitly trusted external directories through `Y2_SKILL_SYMLINK_AUTHORITIES`

### Improvements

- **Provider model catalogs:** Show provider-advertised models, context windows, and effort levels in `/model` and the status line
- **Session listings:** Show saved session names, readable UTC timestamps, language names, and singular turn counts while preserving the existing JSON fields
- **Session cache reads:** Keep session listings and latest-session resume responsive while another session defers cache publication
- **Terminal tab titles:** Label interactive tabs with the session or workspace and active model, keep them current across rename, resume, and model changes, and clear them on exit
- **Terminal activity:** Keep each command or shell attached to its terminal activity row through completion, distinguish graceful close from force close, and hide no-op `cd . &&` prefixes
- **Terminal action arguments:** Advertise only the fields relevant to the selected action and limit unsaved `y2 ask` sessions to `terminal.exec`
- **Auto mode reads:** Run routine read-only commands and hardened Git inspection directly without automatic review
- **Automatic denial recovery:** Return destructive actions to the agent for replanning and finish repeated no-progress denials as normal assistant output instead of opening a permission prompt
- **One-off subagents:** Keep active one-off subagents visible, deliver one final result, and retire them after completion while leaving persistent subagents reusable
- **Startup preferences:** Show saved reasoning effort and Fast mode immediately while model capabilities load
- **Dev build identity:** Add the commit and `[dev]` marker to dev-channel welcome headers without changing stable release headers
- **MCP reload feedback:** Replace internal health details with concise server availability and recovery guidance
- **Help layout:** Keep command descriptions close to command names on wide terminals
- **Native binary size:** Reduce the macOS arm64 release footprint while preserving existing behavior
- **Stable upgrades:** Restore forward-only version ordering across manual, automatic, and Ctrl+G upgrades

### Bug Fixes

- **Oversized images:** Normalize large macOS image snapshots without changing the originals and reject attachments locally when a bounded snapshot cannot be prepared
- **Corrupt memory stores:** Report malformed, oversized, or unreadable stores and preserve their original bytes instead of overwriting them
- **Non-regular file reads:** Reject FIFOs and other non-regular `read_file` targets before they can block
- **Malformed tool loops:** End a turn after three consecutive malformed-only tool batches and reset recovery after a valid batch
- **Terminal null placeholders:** Treat textual `"null"` values as absent for unused terminal fields while preserving real command text that contains the word
- **Terminal keyboard input:** Ignore unknown completed escape sequences and handle Ghostty kitty Escape reports with Caps Lock, Num Lock, and event suffixes
- **Credential fallback:** Continue to a stored API key when saved `y2 login` credentials cannot load or refresh while keeping the login failure available for diagnostics
- **Vision recovery:** Retry replay-safe requests once after a post-Vision assistant-prefill rejection
- **Thinking status:** Keep the Thinking indicator and elapsed timer visible while automatic command review runs
- **Terminal helper compatibility:** Reject unsupported start, signal, and force-close requests from stale terminal helpers without losing unrelated sessions
- **WASM project context:** Skip unavailable local project-instruction probes in browser hosts while preserving host-supplied context
- **Idle terminal traffic:** Stop polling the terminal theme while idle and continue retinting after supported theme notifications

### Security

- **Command approval patterns:** Restrict wildcard command allows to static shell words and keep destructive shell commands and file deletion outside automatic review
- **macOS login storage:** Store native `y2 login` sessions in Keychain with verified migration, refresh, restart, and logout behavior
- **MCP configuration writes:** Save `~/.y2/mcp.json` atomically with private permissions, reject linked targets, and preserve the previous configuration when a write fails
- **MCP session retirement:** Keep retired HTTP session IDs alive until in-flight requests drain
- **Provider response limits:** Reject oversized Codex and Grok catalogs, streams, tool data, and replay state while keeping later input usable
- **ACP permission validation:** Validate permission input before writing JSON-RPC frames

## 0.0.4

### New Features

- **Session resume command:** Resume the latest workspace session or an exact session ID with `y2 session resume`
- **Headless permission prompts:** Add `--prompt-permissions` so JSON and quiet `y2 ask` runs can request Y/N approval on a TTY while keeping stdout clean

### Improvements

- **Auto mode permissions:** Run routine reversible development commands and new-file creation directly, then ask for human approval after repeated automatic review denials
- **Command discovery:** Rank exact, prefix, and substring slash-command matches and highlight the selected help description
- **Terminal attention bells:** Emit one terminal bell when y2 pauses for permission or other input so terminal multiplexers can flag waiting panes
- **Transcript scrollback:** Preserve retained transcript rows in native scrollback across pruning, resize, and reflow

### Bug Fixes

- **Session cache contention:** Continue same-workspace session writes and keep listing and resume results current while another process holds the latest-session cache lock
- **Reasoning effort settings:** Change reasoning effort without crashing or replacing the selected model
- **Web redirects:** Follow HTTP 303 redirects in `web_fetch`
- **Command output separation:** End command output that lacks a trailing newline before rendering the next `y2 ask` tool header
- **Skill discovery:** Show one entry for skills reached through symlinked compatibility roots while preserving distinct same-name skills
- **liby2 session transitions:** Cancel active cooperative turns before starting a fresh session so the terminal remains responsive
- **Memory activity:** Present `memory list` as a read instead of a write
- **Unsupported login shells:** Fall back to zsh on macOS or Bash elsewhere when the configured login shell is unsupported
- **Process cleanup:** Cancel and reap headless terminal commands on SIGTERM, preserve signal status, and tolerate short-lived Linux processes disappearing during cleanup
- **Model output limits:** Omit invalid limits that consume a model's full context window
- **Terminal lease transitions:** Reject write payloads on lease acquisition, release, and revocation before session state changes

## 0.0.3

### Improvements

- **JSON recovery progress:** Report retry, recovery, and safety-pause status on stderr during `y2 ask --json` while keeping stdout parseable
- **Notification sounds:** Use clearer 48 kHz AAC cues with full tails and the intended volume differences between actions

### Bug Fixes

- **Memory clearing:** Succeed when memory is already absent, but report real deletion failures instead of claiming memories were cleared
- **Background URLs:** Refuse `/background open` for stopped or stale tasks so saved URLs cannot open an unrelated process after port reuse
- **Model catalogs:** Reject malformed catalog responses with a nonzero exit instead of treating them as an empty model list
- **Skill creation:** Show invalid `/skills create` names inline and keep the current session, transcript, and composer usable
- **GLM 5.2 responses:** Restore responses for y2 login sessions without changing requests for other models

## 0.0.2

### New Features

- **Unified terminal execution:** Run captured foreground commands and durable interactive sessions through the `terminal` tool, with the user's shell profile loaded by default and `clean` as an explicit opt-out
- **Saved session permissions:** Store exact allow or deny rules with `/permissions remember`, list them by stable ID, and remove them with `/permissions revoke`
- **MCP server awareness:** Show the agent the configured server aliases, availability, and visible tool counts so it can find and use MCP capabilities

### Improvements

- **Auto mode recovery:** Let the agent revise its plan after denied, timed-out, or invalid reviews and return a tools-disabled response after repeated blocks instead of stalling for approval
- **Trusted auto mode actions:** Allow bounded reads, hardened read-only Git commands, and prepared workspace edits to proceed without extra review while keeping ambiguous or sensitive actions gated
- **MCP connection reliability:** Connect to legacy stdio servers, cancel stalled reloads, and report the required `oauth.issuer` override when issuers do not match
- **MCP failure handling:** Show concise server errors and stop a third matching failed call before it runs
- **Terminal action recovery:** Reject invalid terminal fields before running anything and return one complete correction without repeating the same repair loop
- **Fast mode defaults:** Start new sessions with `zai/glm-5.2` without enabling Fast mode while preserving explicit preferences and `/fast`

### Bug Fixes

- **WebAssembly terminal input:** Keep input responsive during continuous streams, queue follow-up prompts until the active response completes, and preserve the queued prompt text
- **Terminal job cleanup:** Force-close descendant jobs spawned by any Linux thread and return `session_lost` when y2 cannot confirm complete cleanup

## 0.0.1

### New Features

- **Current y2 documentation:** Route questions about y2 through the public documentation index before answering

### Improvements

- **Scoped project instructions:** Continue safe read-only inspections after loading more specific project instructions and defer only affected state-changing tools
- **Light terminal readability:** Improve syntax highlighting and help contrast on light terminal backgrounds while keeping redirected and structured output uncolored
- **Transcript review navigation:** Preserve tail following, scroll bookmarks, and expanded command history when switching between Ctrl+O Review and Full detail
- **Binary size safeguards:** Track native binary growth across every supported platform
- **Release validation reliability:** Harden asynchronous terminal and Gateway readiness checks to prevent false failures

### Bug Fixes

- **Wrapped diff layout:** Keep wrapped file-diff rows aligned with their gutters across Inline, Review, and Full detail
- **Inline picker layout:** Keep the transcript and composer adjacent when closing inline pickers instead of leaving a blank band in the frame
- **Native Node.js fetch lifecycle:** Keep native sessions reusable after early response completion, cancel only the matching host fetch, and reject incompatible addon versions before startup
- **Terminal cleanup:** Allow tmux sessions a bounded settling period after shutdown while retaining strict ownership checks
